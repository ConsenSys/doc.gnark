# Serialize

## `gnark` objects

`gnark` objects implements `io.WriterTo` and `io.ReaderFrom` interfaces.

Serialization is straightforward

```go
// compile a circuit
cs, err := frontend.Compile(ecc.BN254, backend.GROTH16, &circuit)

// cs implements io.WriterTo
var buf bytes.Buffer
cs.WriteTo(&buf)
```

To deserialize, you first need to instantiate a *curve-typed* object, and per `gnark` API design choices, these objects are not directly accessible (under `internal/`).

```go
// instantiate a curve-typed object
cs := groth16.NewCS(ecc.BN254)
// cs implements io.ReaderFrom
cs.ReadFrom(&buf)
```

!!!important
    Constraint systems (`R1CS` and `SparseR1CS`, for `Groth16` and `PLONK`) are currently using the `cbor` serialization protocol.

    Other `gnark` objects, like `ProvingKey`, `VerifyingKey` or `Proof` contains elliptic curve points, and use a binary serialization protocol, allowing [point compression](#compression).

    Nothing prevents using another protocol like so:
    ```go
    enc := cbor.NewEncoder(&buf)
	enc.Encode(verifyingKey)
    ```

    but we strongly discourage it as for security reasons, deserialization must also perform curve and subgroup checks.


## Compression

Elliptic curve points, which are the main citizens of `ProvingKey`, `VerifyingKey` or `Proof` objects can be compressed by storing only the `X` coordinate and a parity bit.

This divides by two the needed `bytes` to represent these objects.

This comes at a **significant CPU cost** on the deserialization side.

These objects implement `io.WriterRawTo`, which doesn't use point compression.

```go
provingKey.WriteRawTo(&buf) // alternatively, provingKey.WriteTo(&buf)
...
pk := groth16.NewProvingKey(ecc.BN254)
pk.ReadFrom(&buf) // reader will detect if points are compressed or not.
```

!!!tip
    Use `WriteRawTo` when deserialization speed >>> storage cost.

    Use `WriteTo` with point compression otherwise.


## Witness

Witnesses (inputs to the `Prove` or `Verify` functions) may be constructed outside of `gnark`, in a non-Go codebase.

While there is no standard yet, we followed similar patterns used by other zk-SNARK libraries.

For performance reason (witnesses can be large), witnesses are encoded using a binary protocol.

There are two types of witnesses:

* Full witness: contains public and secret inputs, needed by `Prove`
* Public witness: contains public inputs only, needed by `Verify`


**Binary protocol**

```
// Full witness     ->  [uint32(nbElements) | publicVariables |Â secretVariables]
// Public witness   ->  [uint32(nbElements) | publicVariables ]
```

where

* `nbElements == len(publicVariables) + len(secretVariables)`.
* each variable (a *field element*) is encoded as a big-endian byte array, where `len(bytes(variable)) == len(bytes(modulus))`

**Ordering**

First, `publicVariables`, then `secretVariables`. Each subset is ordered from the order of definition in the circuit structure.

For example, with this circuit on `ecc.BN254`
```go
type Circuit struct {
    X frontend.Variable
    Y frontend.Variable `gnark:",public"`
    Z frontend.Variable
}
```

A valid witness would be:

* `[uint32(3)|bytes(Y)|bytes(X)|bytes(Z)]`
* Hex representation with values `Y = 35`, `X = 3`, `Z = 2`
`00000003000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000030000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002`

!!!note
    In the upcoming `v0.5.0` release, we want to offer additional solutions for non-Go codebase.

    See this [Github issue](https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnark/issues/70).

### Example in Go

This is intended for multi-process usage of `gnark`.

For example [`gnarkd`](use/gnarkd.md) needs to construct the witness in one process and deserialize it in another.

!!!tip
    If the witness creation and proof creation live in the same process, refer to [Construct the witness](prove.md).

!!! example "Full witness in Go"
    ```go
    // witness
    var w cubic.Circuit
	w.X.Assign(3)
	w.Y.Assign(35)

    // io.Writer
    var buf bytes.Buffer

	witness.WriteFullTo(&buf, ecc.BN254, &w)
    // respectively witness.WritePublicTo(&buf, ecc.BN254, &w)
    ...
    // in another process
    proof, _ := groth16.ReadAndProve(cs, pk, &buf)
    // respectively groth16.ReadAndVerify(proof, vk, &buf)
    ```
