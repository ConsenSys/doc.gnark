description: Proving schemes and curves
---

TODO @youssef:

(suggestions):
- link to resources
- 20 lines on why pick a scheme over another, with a concrete comparaison table between PLONK and Groth16 that `gnark` supports
- why pick a curve over another, short version (ie targeted at non-cryptographers experimenting with ZKP in their app / protocols, I guess)
